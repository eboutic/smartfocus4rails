1.0.2 (2013-11-15)
------
Add optional params to Message::create_and_add_action_url.
    Params optional is
     - page_ok : The URL to call if the action was successful
     - message_ok : The message to display if the action was successful
     - page_error : The URL to call if the action was unsuccessful
     - message_error : The message to display if the action was unsuccessful
    Due to a bug in API this params is require. If you don't need this params, you must fill it with fake data.
    page_ok and page_error can be any text. message_ok and message_error must be an real message id (with syntaxic error)
    We reverse this workaround as soon as Smartfocus team resolve the issue.
